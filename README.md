# 3phase_circuit

## Description
This code calculates the voltages and powers of a three-phase power system with a Delta connection using MATLAB. The system consists of three sources with different voltages, three inductors, a capacitor, and a mutual inductor. The code uses symbolic values of the circuit components and calculates the admittances and impedances for each phase. It then calculates the total admittance, excitation vector, and potential for each phase, as well as the branch currents and the voltages and powers for the loads in each phase. Finally, it calculates the powers for the sources and the loads in each phase.

## Installation
To run this code, you will need MATLAB installed on your computer.

## Usage
Open the code in MATLAB and run it. The results will be displayed in the command window.
